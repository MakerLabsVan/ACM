Access Control Management system

This system is designed to authorize access to MakerLabs' laser cutter by an RFID tag. The system consists of an Arduino Uno, an RDM880-T-A breakout board, and an ESP8266 breakout board. This module actively scans for RFID tags that follow the ISO14443A protocol. Details on ISO14443A, specifically MiFare, can be found in ACM/Documentation/ISO14443AB.pdf.
